## Student-Management-Project

 Tech Stack: Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3

Full-Stack Development: Engineered a complete client-server application from scratch to provide a user-friendly platform for managing student information.

RESTful Backend Server: Built a robust backend using Node.js and Express.js, creating RESTful API endpoints for all CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE). Ensured efficient and secure communication between the client and the database.

Dynamic Frontend Interface: Implemented a clean and responsive frontend using vanilla JavaScript to make asynchronous API calls with the Fetch API. This allows for real-time data manipulation (adding, editing, deleting students) without requiring page reloads.

Relational Database Management: Designed and integrated a MySQL database to persistently store and manage student data, including names, emails, and course information. Wrote and executed SQL scripts to initialize the database schema.
